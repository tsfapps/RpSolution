Problem Statement: It’s a leave management system project, used in any organization. The Leave Management module in the company allows their employees to manage their own leaves data. Employees can apply for leave via a mobile application (platform independent) and view their leave record with information on leaves availed, canceled along with the annual leave balance summary. All leave applications go through an automatic approval process, wherein, the employee’s manager is informed of leave applications via an automatic email generated by the system in the app. There should be 3 types of accounts involved in this Leave management system Android App  Employee account  Manager account  LMS admin account 1. The employee should apply to leave through employee account. 2. Once you log in, you should see your profile page. (emp id, emp name,) 3. There should be a navigation Menu.
